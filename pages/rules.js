                            200 Lounge is a <a href="https://discord.gg/uR3rRzsjhk">Discord server</a> dedicated to hosting instant wars for MK8DX, while also serving as a community-based server to help increase activity with players and teams in the 200cc community. 12 players can gather and play an event at any time. All other public channels have their own purposes for players and teams outside of lounge events. See channel descriptions in the server for more information on how the channels in the community section should be properly used.

                            Making an alternate account to join lounge will result in a heavy penalty in lounge and MKCentral. MKCentral Staff will find out if an alternate account is made, so it is highly recommended to not do so.

                            3. Subs are allowed in Squad Queue events; however, the sub&apos;s MMR must keep their team&apos;s average MMR within the range of the room. In other words, if a team would be in a different room if their team MMR was different, then the sub is not allowed.
                        </ul>
                        <ul className='m-4'>
                            4. If a team gets a sub which would put their average MMR in a different room, the whole team will receive <penalty>-50 and a strike</penalty> at minimum. If the team wins more than 50 MMR, the penalty will be increased to match the amount of MMR they would have gained.
                        </ul>

                            5. If the host has been decided after opening time, the host has to wait 2 minutes to open the room. Players need to be in the room in 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, the host can start Mogi even if there are not 12 players in the room.
