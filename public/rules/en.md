## I. WHAT IS 200 LOUNGE? {#i-what-is-200-lounge}
______________

200 Lounge is a competitive solo ladder for the MK8DX 200cc engine class. To compete in events you will need to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uR3rRzsjhk "Discord invite") where we host 24/7 instant wars. 12 players can gather and play an event at any time. All other public channels have their own purposes for players and teams outside of lounge events. See channel descriptions in the server for more information.

## II. JOINING THE LOUNGE {#ii-joining-the-lounge}
______________

Use the **`/verify`** command in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uR3rRzsjhk "Discord invite") to provide the leaderboard system with your [Mario Kart Central](https://www.mariokartcentral.com/mkc/ "mariokartcentral.com") account. A tutorial video on how to do this can be found in the [#verification-info](https://discord.gg/uR3rRzsjhk "Discord invite") channel in the Discord server.

For help making a registry account, refer to [this guide.](https://www.mariokartcentral.com/wp/mkcentral-registry-guide/ "MKCentral Registry Guide")

You can request nickname, once every 60 days, by using the **`/name`** command in the Discord server.

Making an alternate account to join lounge will result in a heavy penalty in lounge and MKCentral. MKCentral Staff will find out if an alternate account is made, so it is highly recommended to not do so.

## III. CODE OF CONDUCT {#iii-code-of-conduct}
______________

### Behavioral Guidelines {#behavioral-guidelines}
The guidelines by which we expect every player to behave include, but are not limited to:
- **Be respectful** - Treat all players with respect and civility, even if you disagree. Discussions in the server are meant to stimulate conversation, not create contention.
- **Be welcoming of new players** - We were all new karters once. Welcome first-time players and those still learning to play. It will set them an example of how to behave and make them want to return!
- **Behave** - Discriminatory, hostile, or intentionally provoking messages or language will not be tolerated, whether based on a person’s race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, socioeconomic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, family status, political belief, religion, or mental or physical ability. Harassment of other players through private messaging or in the server will not be tolerated. 
- **Be cool** - 200 Lounge is meant to be fun. If you become angry or frustrated, take a break. Don't act out your anger in a way that could ruin the experience for others.
- **Be appropriate** - Remember, 200 Lounge is home to players of all ages. Keep your posts appropriate. Inappropriate content has no place in our community.

These guidelines also apply to your Lounge Name, in-game name  or any public-facing aspect of your profile in any of our social spaces.
### Player Reporting {#player-reporting}
If you see behavior in the server that does not comply with our guidelines, we urge you to create a ticket by clicking the **Create ticket** button in the [#support](https://discord.gg/uR3rRzsjhk "Discord invite") channel. Your ticket should include:
- The date & time that the offenses started
- Timezone you are reporting from
- Screenshots of the offenses
- Links to the offending messages, if applicable
### Breaches of Conduct {#breaches-of-conduct}
We take our Code of Conduct seriously. Accounts that we determine to have breached our Code of Conduct will have action taken on them. Account actions may range from warnings and restrictions to permanent termination from the Lounge. Breaches of conduct are reviewed by multiple members of the moderation team and acted upon at our discretion. Should a player attempt to circumvent enforcement action by using an alternate account, all associated accounts will be terminated immediately. The staff team reserves the right to remove any player from the Lounge.

## IV. JOINING AN EVENT {#iv-joining-an-event}
______________

1. Go to the [#tier]() channels under the Lounge section of the Discord server

2. Use the **`/start`** command to start the mogi.

3. Use the **`/can`** command to join the mogi

4. The first twelve players to say **`/can`** or **`/c`** will play. Any players later than 12th on the list will be subs, given priority by their order on the list.

5. Once 12 players have gathered, MogiBot will start a poll to vote for a format.

6. After the voting phase, teams will be randomly assigned.

7. Lounge events take place in Friend Rooms. Once the teams have been randomized, a host will need to provide their Friend Code.

8. Once 12 players have joined the Friend Room, the host should start the room with these settings:

```
Class: 200cc
Teams: No Teams
Items: Normal Items
COM: Hard COM
COM Vehicles: All Vehicles
Race Count: 12 Races
```

## V. RANKING SYSTEM {#v-ranking-system}
______________

### Ranks {#ranks}

Once your account is verified, you will be able to play your first match which will place you into one of the following ranks:

- Iron: 0-1499 (Placement: 1000)
- Bronze: 1500-2999 (Placement: 2250)
- Silver: 3000-4499 (Placement: 3750)

## VI. MATCH RULES {#vi-match-rules}
______________

1. Once a room has been opened, players will have 5 minutes to join the room. Players that join the room late will receive a *-50 MMR* and a *strike*.

2. Players who do not join the room 5 minutes after the penalty time will receive *-100* and a *strike* and must be replaced by a sub as soon as possible. The mogi should NOT be started with less than 12 players.

3. If a player seems to be purposefully delaying the room, they can be subbed out. This would hold the same consequences as dropping from the line-up.

4. Players who leave an event after the poll has started:
	1. Do not gain MMR on a winning team.
	2. Receive *1 strike* and a *-100 MMR* penalty.
	3. Lose any MMR their team lost in addition to the strike.

5. Players who sub in a match that has already started:
	1. Must be placed on the table instead of the person they subbed.
	2. Do not lose MMR on a losing team.
	3. Only gain MMR on the winning team if they play 4 or more races in said event.
	4. In a situation where placing a sub on a table results in -MMR and placing the dropped player on the table results in +MMR, the player who played more races should be listed on the table.
	5. In the same situation above, if both players played exactly 6 races, the sub should be listed on the table.

6. Players are not allowed to type **`/c`** while already participating in a mogi. Players who violate this rule will receive *-50 MMR* and a *strike*.

7. Course repicks in an FFA will receive a *-10 score* penalty.

8. Course repicks in team events will receive a *-50 MMR* penalty.

9. Courses repicked more than once will incur 1 strike and a *-100* MMR penalty for each repick chosen.

10. Players who have an incorrect tag for more than 2 races will receive *-25 MMR* and a *strike*

11. Teams missing a player for at least 4 races will get ⅔ MMR loss.

12. Teams missing a player for at least 6 races will get ½ MMR loss.

13. Teams missing a player for more than 6 races will receive an MMR loss proportional to the number of races the missing player is absent from. For instance, if a player is missing for 10 races, the team will receive 2/12 loss. The missing player will still lose MMR and will receive an additional *-100 MMR* + *strike* penalty.

14. If a player drops after the 1st race, their teammates can choose whether or not to find a sub for the dropped player

15. If any players happen to be intentionally throwing, teaming, or lap-trolling and there is convincing proof, staff has the right to bestow a *-100 MMR* penalty and a *strike* on the individual in question.

16. Hosts that start the room with less than 12 players, close the room for no reason, or otherwise cause unnecessary disruptions will receive *-50 MMR* and a *strike*, and may be prohibited from hosting in the future. In a mogi, hosts must take a 30-second clip to prove that it was unintentional (streaming archive is also allowed). Typing !hostban in any channel will show the list of host-banned players.

17. 12 full races must be completed. If 12 races are not completed, the event will not count.

18. If there is no host for a mogi 20 minutes after the poll ends, the entire lineup will receive *-50 MMR* and a *strike*.

19. Hosts must wait 2 minutes after posting their friend code before opening the room to accept friend requests. Other players may request the room to be reopened, if the room was opened early. Refusal will incur *1 strike* to the host.

20. If a player is unable to sub when needed or does not respond within 5 minutes, they will receive a *-50 MMR* penalty and a *strike*.

21. Players who ignore the order of sub priority will receive *-50 MMR* and a *strike*.

22. After 8 races have passed in the current mogi, users not currently playing are allowed to start a new mogi by typing **`/esn`** (esn = end start new).

23. Players must use their Lounge Nickname (or a shortened version if more than 10 characters) in FFA format events. Refusal after the first 2 races will result in *-50 MMR*.

### DISCONNECTIONS {#disconnections}

23. In the event that a player disconnects before the first race of a mogi starts (by the end of Lakitu Countdown), the room must be restarted regardless of video proof submissions. This rule only applies once, if a player disconnects before the first race a second time the room should continue without closing. A player should provide video proof (switch clip, stream, error history etc.) of their disconnection if requested; otherwise they will receive -50 MMR and a strike. If the host does not restart, the first race will not count and an additional 13th race will need to be played at the end.

24. If 3 or more players from at least 2 different teams disconnect, the race will not count and the room must be reopened.​ The affected players must provide video evidence of their disconnects.

25. If a race does not finish due to lag, the race will not be counted and the room will be reopened.​ The host should provide video evidence of the disconnect.

26. If item roulette is prominent for most of a race, the race will not count and the room must be reopened.

27. If no races can be finished for an extended amount of time due to lag, the event can be canceled with no players losing MMR.

28. If this happens to occur during an event, please attempt to capture video proof of the individual who may be causing the lag in the room. If the proof is convincing, and if the majority of the room agrees on who is causing the lag, staff have the right to punish the individual for a certain amount of time, or warn them to fix their connection before playing again.

## VII. SUBMITTING RESULTS {#vii-submitting-results}

1. Submit a table using the **`/table`** command. Provide a format (1, 2, 3, or 4) and a list of 12 players & 12 scores, alternating.

Example of a properly formatted **`/table`** command:

```
/table 2 Brandon 76 popuko 80+5 Technical 93 SuperFX 141 Nino 102 mktristan 73 Espurr 87 Nick 92 Euan 70 Francis 49 Jakearoo 76 AlexYT 40
```

If there is an issue with your command, our Discord bot should inform you of what is causing the error.

2. Any penalties accumulated during the match must be stated by the reporter submitting the table, after the table has been posted in the results channel

3. Room hosts are responsible for taking screenshots of results. If an event fails to have a screenshot or table created within 30 minutes of the last race, the match will not count and the host of the room will receive *-100 MMR* and a *strike*.

4. Only certain people will be given access to the results channels in order to prevent spam. If you want to become a reporter, look in the [#self-roles](https://discord.gg/uR3rRzsjhk "Discord invite") channel in the Discord server

## VIII. STRIKE SYSTEM {#viii-strike-system}
______________
1. Strikes expire after 30 days.

2. Players have a limit of 3 strikes.

3. Players who receive MMR penalties for quitting matches, lap-trolling, joining the room late, teaming, or any of the offenses listed in above sections will receive a strike.

4. Players who reach the 3 strike limit will be banned from Lounge for 1 week. Each time the strike limit is reached, the ban will increase by an additional week.

## IX. SQUAD QUEUE {#ix-squad-queue}
______________

1. Squad Queue is a different way of playing lounge that allows players to play with predetermined teammates.

2. If a player fails to show up for a match, misses at least half of an event, or trolls during an event (IV. h, IV. j) they will receive *-100 MMR* and a *strike*.

3. Subs are allowed in Squad Queue events; however, the sub's MMR must keep their team's average MMR within the range of the room. In other words, if a team would be in a different room if their team MMR was different, then the sub is not allowed.

4. If a team gets a sub which would put their average MMR in a different room, the whole team will receive *-50 MMR* and a *strike* at minimum. If the team wins more than 50 MMR, the penalty will be increased to match the amount of MMR they would have gained.

5. If the host has been decided after opening time, the host has to wait 2 minutes to open the room. Players need to be in the room in 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, the host can start Mogi even if there are not 12 players in the room.

## X. CONCLUSION {#x-conclusion}
______________

1. Playing in the lounge is a privilege. Users who breach our code of conduct, ignore the guidelines above, or abuse commands may be removed from the Lounge at any time without warning.

2. We hope you enjoy your Lounge experience!
